# Lawlease-AI-Chatbot-using-Image-Analysis

Lawlease AI is an intelligent chatbot system designed to analyze legal documents‚Äîspecifically lease agreements‚Äîusing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). By uploading an image or scanned copy of a legal lease, users can interact with the chatbot to ask legal questions about the document‚Äôs content, such as terms, clauses, responsibilities, and more.

This project bridges the gap between legal documentation and user understanding by combining image analysis with conversational AI, making legal terms more accessible and easier to understand.

üîç Key Features

Image to Text Conversion (OCR): Extracts text from images or scanned lease documents using OCR technology.

Legal Clause Understanding: Uses NLP to identify and interpret key clauses such as rent terms, notice periods, maintenance responsibilities, and renewal conditions.

AI-Powered Chatbot: Allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive contextual, document-specific answers.

Secure & Private: Keeps uploaded documents and chat interactions secure and confidential.

Multilingual Support (Optional): Can be extended to support multiple languages for global usability.

üìÅ Use Cases

Tenants or landlords seeking to understand specific lease clauses.

Legal professionals reviewing multiple lease agreements quickly.

Real estate platforms automating lease explanation for users.

Students or researchers studying legal documents and clauses.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
